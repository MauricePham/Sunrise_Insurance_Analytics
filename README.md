## **Situation**
In 2023, Sunrise Life Insurance is looking to anticipate which customers are likely to lapse on their policies. By
identifying such customers, the company intends to proactively reach out to them with some customer care
program in a bid to retain them.

To achieve this, Sunrise Life Insurance will need to employ predictive analytics techniques that can analyze vast
amounts of data on customers and other relevant factors. Once the predictive model has been developed,
the company will use it to generate a list of customers who are at high risk of lapsing. The company will then reach out
to these customers with tailored offers that are designed to meet their unique needs and preferences.

**The goal is to leverage data insights to improve customer satisfaction, reduce lapse, and increase customer
loyalty.**
